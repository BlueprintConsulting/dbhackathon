# Attribution Modelling Use Case

We've provided a series of datasets which contain purchase history for users, and marketing touchpoint data for those users across three distinct marketing channels.

The goal of this use case is to be able to extract useful insights from the data.  To do this, you will need to do the following:

1. Pull all the datasets into Databricks
2. Join and aggregate the datasets to get customer journey's leading up to each purchase event
3. Analyze customer journey data to extract actionable insights

To help kickstart item 3 above, we've provided a simple Databricks notebook, which you can find here: [Link to Notebook](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BlueprintConsulting/dbhackathon/master/notebooks/Attribution%20Modelling.py).
